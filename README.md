Typing is the technique and practice of writing by using a keyboard. Typing is not usually taught in the national educational system but it has several applications in professional jobs such as typists and any other people who works with a computer. These people need a training method that is intuitive, easy to use and open-source. All of these requirements can be satisfied through website design. There are many web realizations of typing training that usually allow the user (Client) to simply practice with a dull and repetitive use of the keyboard. This thesis focuses on the interaction and entertainment through a catchy and modern graphic style as well as incremental exercises difficulty and challenging interaction between users. This has been implemented with a modular programming approach using standard programming languages and tools such as HTML5, JavaScript with the JQuery library support, JSON and AJAX. The graphics is done using CSS sheets. The challenging interaction between users is based on Client-Server paradigm featuring the server implementation via PHP interfaces. The database access is programmed in Structured Query Language(SQL) and the Database Management System(DBMS) is “PostgreSQL”.

Requirements:
Apache services like XAMPP,
Server PostgreSQL with pgAdmin4
